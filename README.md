SauriCogs are cogs made by me for [Red Discord Bot (V3)](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/).

## Contact me

There’s multiple ways to contact me. The best and fastest way is to join [my own Discord server (SauriCord)](https://discord.gg/Q5KX6kS), assign yourself a role in #unlock-me and then head over to #sauricogs channel in the Social category. I have notifications turned on for that channel so you don’t need to ping me.

Other ways (slower) are: <a href="mailto:ellie@saurich.com?subject=SauriCogs">emailing me</a>, <a href="https://github.com/elijabesu/SauriCogs/issues">opening an issue on my GitHub</a>, or joining <a href="https://discord.gg/GET4DVk">Red - Cog Support</a> and pinging me there (Ellie~♡#0001).

If you have any suggestions to my cogs, feel free to ping me, I'm very open to ideas.

## How to install

Type `[p]repo add SauriCogs https://github.com/elijabesu/SauriCogs/` to add the repo.

Type `[p]cog install SauriCogs <cog>` to install your desired cog.

## Cogs

Click on the cog names to get to my wiki page and learn about them.

***I highly suggest reading through the guides as some cogs may be a bit complicated*** *(yes, I'm talking about Advanced Lock because not even I understand that shit)****!***

### *If you're considering downloading and using AdvancedLock, you NEED to read the Wiki page!* It will break your entire server if you use it incorrectly and I do not take any responsibility in that.
