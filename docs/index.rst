Contact me
------------

There's multiple ways to contact me. The best and fastest way is to
`join my own Discord server (SauriCord) <https://discord.gg/Q5KX6kS>`__,
assign yourself a role in ``#unlock-me`` and then head over to ``#sauricogs`` channel
in the Social category. I have notifications turned on for that channel so you
don't need to ping me.

Other ways (slower) are: `emailing me <http://saurich.com/contact-me/>`__, 
`opening an issue on my GitHub <https://github.com/elijabesu/SauriCogs/issues>`__,
or `joining Red - Cog Support <https://discord.gg/GET4DVk>`__ and pinging me there.

If you have any suggestions to my cogs, feel free to contact me, I'm very open to ideas.
